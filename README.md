# pysplay
Python library for graphical user interfaces on Linux powered embedded devices.  
The graphics engine is built using a modem and fast graphics pipeline.  
Touchscreen and small TFT devices are fully supported.  
Small footprint, **XWindow is not required**, framebuffer only and minimal interface for
poor and really cheap TFT/LCD/HDMI screens.
